After a break caused by the pandemic, we await you, eager for being together, listening together to the lectures of our wonderful teachers, exchanging experiences, getting inspired, and having fun together at the banquet. The aim of the Congress is to create a special meeting place for Chinese medicine therapists from various parts of Poland and the world, where they can learn from experienced lecturers and practitioners of TCM, develop and integrate in order to recharge their batteries, fill up with knowledge, and better serve patients in their clinics. The autumn colors, extraordinary streets of Krakow, walks along the Vistula, around the Market Square or Kazimierz create a beautiful scenery for this event. We are extremely happy that extraordinary TCM teachers will come specially to Krakow to share their knowledge and experience, answer questions, and be there for us. We are also happy that we will all meet. We look forward to seeing you in Krakow!!!",
